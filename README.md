## MovieMatch

Welcome, this is our assigmenent for our school project called: `project tech`. For this project we're going to make a application where all of our feature's are included in this common application. Take a look our [WIKI](https://github.com/Alexiatech/Tech-D-groepsopdracht/wiki) for more information! (written in `Dutch`). 

MovieMatch is a web application designed to help you discover movies. However, if you're unsure of what to watch, we have a feature that allows you to find movies that match your preferences. By answering a few questions, our algorithm will generate personalized recommendations to help you find movies that fit your mood. 

## Team TECH-D

Our team exists of 5 members from the TEC1 class. I would recommend you to read into our personal application's first before you will look at our common applicaiton. You'll be able to find our personal application behind our name's.

## ![install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118122875/224570019-3d6ab194-d3ef-458e-b9b6-d66a5cf39809.png) How to install

### Pre-installation:

Before you install the `MovieMates`, make sure to install:

### [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* First type `git install` in your terminal
* Type `git --version` the check if node is installed correctly
### [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* First type `node install` in your terminal
* Type `node --version` the check if node is installed correctly
> You'll recieve the what type of version you installed like:`v18.8.0` 
### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog)

* Before you can start MovieMates you'll need to create a database with multiple collections. I use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/blog) to save up the data (information) for this application. Follow the steps underneath, you can also follow this [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/):
1. Create a cluster, i would recommend you to use the name cluster0
2. Create a database, choose your own name
3. Then you'll create the first collection called: `"Movies"`. In this collection we will store the information about the movies that we render in our application. Use the following template to set up your collection:
>  Using the correct names given in this tutorial, for the `collection` is super important!

| 'Field' (input)| 'Value' (input)| 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| _ID (Automatic generated) | Random number made by mongoDB |
| title: | (You can put any title name here) | 
| descriptions: | (You can put any descriptions here) | 
| genre: | (Make sure to use the genre: Action, Sports, Animation & Horror) | 
| language: | (You can put any language here) |
| Imgurl: | (example: "Thegodfather.jpg") Make sure this matched with the name of the photo in the static map | 

```
4. add atleast `4 different movies` for each genre: Action, Sports, Animation & Horror into your collection `Movies`
```
5. Then you'll create the second collection called: `"Users"`. In this collection we will store the information about the user and the specific movies this user saved. 
>  Using the correct names given in this tutorial, for the `collection` is super important!

| 'Field' (input)| 'Value' (input)| 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| _ID (Automatic generated) | Random number made by mongoDB |
| Username: | (value) | 
| Firstname: | (value) | 
| Lastname: | (value) | 
| Phonenumber: | (value) | 
| Password: | (value) | 
| City: | (value) | 
| email: | (value) | 
| DateOfBirth: | (value) | 
| Likes: | (value) | 

### [env.](https://www.codementor.io/@parthibakumarmurugesan/what-is-env-how-to-set-up-and-run-a-env-file-in-node-1pnyxw9yxj)
* Once you have created the databases you'll need to create an .env in the root of the folder you work from, for this application. This .env file should contain one variable.
```
 DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://thijmen:FCdkI91K5ePdjZ1h@cluster0.x9618m8.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
We added the connection string from our MongoDB Database and filled in our unique login credentials in the MongoDB Database enviorment.

### App-installation:

Clone our respository to your local device:

```

git clone (https://github.com/Alexiatech/Tech-D-groepsopdracht.git)

```

When you cloned this repository, created a replica of the database and added the env. file make sure to follow the following steps:
### [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)
* First type `npm install` in your terminal
* Type `npm --version` the check if node is installed correctly

### [Open your terminal](https://support.apple.com/nl-nl/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)
* In the terminal you type: `npm start` to start [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server, which will start the MovieMatcher on the web.
* The website should be visible with the link underneath:
```

http://localhost:4000/

```

* MovieMates only works for a mobile screen so make sure you switch to a mobile screens. You'll will be able to do this to open the inspector tool on google chrome by the following code for mac OS: `Option + âŒ˜ + J`, and the following code for windows: `Shift + CTRL + J on Windows)`.
